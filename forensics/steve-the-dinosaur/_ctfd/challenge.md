Steve's a cheeky fella. He's a stegosaurus who won't shut up about it and because he's vegetarian, he loves to eat noodles but never tells us his favourite type of noodles. Instead he has just sent us a selfie of his best fit and expects us to find his favourite noodle. He tells us this image is hidden inside a flag within the image. Find the flag!

**Format**: THIS CHALLENGE IS WRAPPED IN `COMPCLUB{}`
