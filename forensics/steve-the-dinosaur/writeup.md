## Description
Steve's a cheeky fella. He's a stegosaurus who won't shut up about it and
because he's vegetarian, he loves to eat noodles but never tells us his 
favourite type of noodles. Instead he has just sent us a selfie of his best fit
and expects us to find his favourite noodle. He tells us this image is hidden
inside a flag within the image. Find the flag!

### Idea
Use steganography tools to reveal some faint text within the image

### Walkthrough
1. There are a couple tools that can be used to find the text:
- Any playing around with stegtools will hopefully reveal the text
- Using a marqee or magic wand like tool will reveal the text

### Flag
