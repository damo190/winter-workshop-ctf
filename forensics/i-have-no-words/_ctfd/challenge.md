I have a geography essay due tomorrow and I've only written about 965 words but it needs to be 1100 words.

Luckily, my friend told me a trick that lets my essay look like it has the correct number of words (including the question). You can even check yourself by pressing Tools at the top and then Word Count.

I've also found this trick is a nice way to hide secrets including CTF flags...
