## Description
I have a geography essay due tomorrow and I've only written about 965 words but
it needs to be 1100 words. Luckily, my friend told me a trick that lets my essay
look like it has the correct number of words (including the question). You can
even check yourself by pressing Tools at the top and then Word Count. I've also
found this trick is a nice way to hide secrets including CTF flags...

2. The last chunk of white text contains the flag
