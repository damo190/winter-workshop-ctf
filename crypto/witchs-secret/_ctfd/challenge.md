It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable. Paula the witch has a confidential message for her coven but wishing for it to be unreadable to man, she enchants it with a special HEX.

Her message may contain plans to destroy humankind so it is important to unenchant this message. It is up to you to decrypt her message and determine what actions we need to take!

Message:
```
