Felix has come up with an amazing way to organise his files and folders. He has used ascii and binary to hide messages that he doesn't want others to see and he only needs to remember a letter to find his hidden files.

He has hidden a flag within in his folders and has been kind enough to give us his personal key that he uses to remember where it is: `c`. See if you can find the flag!



**Format**: THIS CHALLENGE IS WRAPPED IN `COMPCLUB{}`
