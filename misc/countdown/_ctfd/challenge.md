Abiram, Felix and Paula have decided to host a new show called 'CompClub does Countdown' and you have been invited to take part in the first episode. There are two sections which you must complete:

**Numbers section**
Using the following numbers `25, 1, 1, 3, 4, 2` once each, get as close as you can to the number 560 with the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

**Letters section**

Find the English word that uses the most number of letters in the list `[L, N, T, E, I, E, R, H, A]` where each letter is only used once.

**Format**: `COMPCLUB{\[WORD\]\[NUMBER\]}` For example, if the correct word was 'example' and the closest number was 570, then the flag would be `COMPCLUB{example570}`.
