ALL THE SOLUTIONS FOR THIS WORKSHOP CAN BE FOUND HERE!!!!!
Navigate to the folder of the excersise and look for the writeup.md file. That has the solution!

Don't ever straight tell students the answer if they are stuck though, always give them guiding ideas, everything should be linked to what was presented in the slides.
